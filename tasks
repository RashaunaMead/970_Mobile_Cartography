REQUESTS FROM ROB AND STEPHEN
-Did we decide to delete the "Find me" feature? It seemed to be disabled on the version we viewed.
-Redesign the "click to proceed" so that the text is not so large and the button is has the same style as the rest of the application. Perhaps fill the entire div with red using white text, so that a click anywhere but the arrows proceeds them to the next site?
-On the non-mobile version, close the text when clicking "Read text aloud". Then when closed, keep the audio active in the interface. In other words, the map should have one or the other.
-When adding the audio to the non-mobile version, add it to the far right of the menu options, rather than the far left, as this will keep the other menu items in their place.
-The Madison zoning map legend gets cut off in the non-mobile version. Overall, we noticed a few issues with cutting off images in the mobile version (e.g., the div was on only the top 50-100 pixels, rather than the entire size of the screen.
-Adjust slider UI so that: (1) the arrows are not just white (perhaps add a grey background to the asset), making them disappear when sliding off the image and (2) they don't overlap the arrows to change images (reposition one or the other, or offset both).
-Change "information" to "about" and use an "a" rather than an "i".
-Add assignment tab that will have an html version of the worksheet.
-Add a final note as 3/3 to Ground Zero page about the assignment. Stephen will provide text for this, but please add a placeholder now.
-In the end, rather than de-highlighting the route to Ground Zero, highlight then entire route as one.


BUGS
-Initial slippy map tiles sometimes don't load (need to migrate off of toolserver)
-View all locations doesn't recenter map on second click
-Reveal modal temporarily fails to open after two clicks on reveal modal link in quick succession (minor)
-CHROME: First map view is sometimes map paradox; fixed on reload

BUGS FROM ROB
-There was an issue on my phone with the tap interaction to scroll through the three pictures and the "proceed" button. Several times I was unable to proceed to a picture using either a tap or a swipe. This was not an issue on the non-mobile version. Perhaps leave the arrows on the mobile version as one work around, as minimally users will be able to click on these to advance the slideshow.
-There were several instances where the zooming and recentering upon selecting a new site used a zoom level where the route was visible, but the two sites were offscreen (this was on mobile). Perhaps zoom out one level by default (or is this a function provided by Leaflet)?
